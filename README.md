# Supported trivias
The original JSON, was taken from here: [GabeMillikan/Wizard101Trivia](https://github.com/GabeMillikan/Wizard101Trivia/blob/main/quiz_data/quizzes.json)

It has been edited to fix a few incorrect entries I have found. Make sure to contact me if you find any others or if anything is missing.

The JSON I have found is also rather old, so I will be adding the new questions here as well eventually.
